## Election Audit Summary
- I believe there are so many more data points we can analyze by modifying our script: 
    -   We could modify our script to capture demographic data in future elections (for example male vs female voters, age brackets, Income and so on)
    - We could also use our script not just for elections but a state or nation wide survey. For example to find the total number of people that filled out the survey, will be the same logic as getting total votes.
